# SIMPLE-APP-CALCULATOR

>This Python file is a simple calculator with addition(+), subraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/) operations. This program can accept both floating and integer input from the user and calculate the value base on the user's choice of operation.

>I created this Python program because of two reasons. First, this project is a university requirement. The second and last reason, I wrote this program is to learn and explore more in the field of programming.
Project Description
This program asks the user for 2 input numbers (in order). Then the program will ask for an operation to perform on the input numbers and outputs the answer. In case of invalid input from the user, the program will print a message and will ask for the necessary input until the user types in the appropriate input. After the initial process is done, the program will ask the user if they need to use the calculator again, if yes, the program will start again and if no, the program is done.

## How to Use?

>To use this program:
>1. The user will need to download the file.

>2. Once downloaded, open the file with any type of Python Integrated Development Environment or IDE and run the program.

>3. Next, once the program is running, the program will ask the user for two input numbers in the terminal.

>4. If the user's input is not a number, the terminal will print a message and the program will ask for the necessary input again.

>5. After typing in the 2 numbers, the program will ask the user to choose an operation. If the user's input is invalid, the program will print a message in the terminal and will ask again for input.

>6. Once the inputs are valid, the program will print the answer and will ask the user if there are any more to calculate.

>7. If yes, the program will ask for other numbers and operations. The process repeats. If not, the program will be done.
